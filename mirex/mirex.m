function train(trainfilelist,scratchdir)

%% input should be:
% extractFeaturesAndTrain  "/path/to/trainFileList.txt"  "/path/to/scratch/dir"  
% where fileList.txt has the paths to each WAV file. The features extracted on this stage can be
% stored under /path/to/scratch/dir. The ground truth files for the supervised learning will be in 
% the same path with a .txt extension at the end. For example for /path/to/trainFile1.wav, there will
% be a corresponding ground truth file called /path/to/trainFile1.wav.txt.


%% load training files
% downsample and compute features (fft 1500 bins)

% training
